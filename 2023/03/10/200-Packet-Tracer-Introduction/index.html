        <p>Welcome to Jeremy’s IT Lab.</p>
<p>This is a complete course for the CCNA, Cisco Certified Network Associate.</p>
<p>In this video we will look at an essential part of the course – the labs in Cisco Packet</p>
<p>Tracer.</p>
<p>First of all, what is a lab?</p>
<p>In the world of IT, ‘doing labs’ or ‘labbing’ refers to hands-on practice with the technology</p>
<p>you’re studying.</p>
<p>Since you’re studying for the CCNA, labbing means practicing configuring Cisco routers</p>
<p>and switches.</p>
<p>There are a few options for CCNA labs.</p>
<p>One is to buy actual physical Cisco hardware, real Cisco routers and switches.</p>
<p>However, that can be expensive and isn’t very convenient.</p>
<p>Fortunately Cisco has an amazing tool called Packet Tracer which lets you set up simulated</p>
<p>networks on your computer.</p>
<p>We will be using Packet Tracer for the labs in this course.</p>
<p>Packet Tracer is free, quick and easy to set up, and lets you create simulated network</p>
<p>labs without having to buy any hardware.</p>
<p>The network devices in packet tracer aren’t real network devices, it’s just software</p>
<p>designed to simulate network devices so you can practice configuring them.</p>
<p>In this video we won’t actually configure any routers and switches, since we haven’t</p>
<p>learned any configurations yet in the course.</p>
<p>Instead we’ll just get familiar with the Packet Tracer user interface and how to build</p>
<p>simple networks.</p>
<p>First of all, how can you download Cisco Packet Tracer?</p>
<p>You can download it for free from Cisco on this page.</p>
<p>Note that I have created a simple redirect link that will take you to this page, it is</p>
<p>jitl.jp&#x2F;packet-tracer.</p>
<p>Follow that link and it will take you here.</p>
<p>However, first you will probably see this login page.</p>
<p>You need a Cisco account to download Packet Tracer.</p>
<p>So, you can log in here.</p>
<p>Or if you don’t have an account yet, click on Sign Up at the bottom of this page to create</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Once you have created an account and logged in, my link jitl.jp&#x2F;packet-tracer will allow</p>
<p>you to see this page.</p>
<p>First let me point out that Cisco’s learning platform Net Academy has a few courses about</p>
<p>how to use Packet Tracer.</p>
<p>If you really want to learn how to master Packet Tracer itself, you can take these courses</p>
<p>like ‘Getting Started with Cisco Packet Tracer’, a short 2 hour course.</p>
<p>Or the one below it, ‘Exploring Networking with Cisco Packet Tracer’.</p>
<p>In my course we won’t look at all of the different functionalities of Packet Tracer,</p>
<p>just the ones we need to do the labs in my course.</p>
<p>So, if you’re interested in learning more about Packet Tracer you can take these free</p>
<p>courses from Cisco.</p>
<p>Anyway, scroll down and this is where you can download Packet Tracer itself.</p>
<p>It is available for Windows in 64-bit and 32-bit versions, as well as Ubuntu and macOS.</p>
<p>Download the appropriate version for your computer, and install it like any other program.</p>
<p>For my course, download the latest version, which is 8.2 at the time I’m making this</p>
<p>video.</p>
<p>If you have an old version, you might not be able to run some of the labs.</p>
<p>Old versions of Packet Tracer can’t open lab files made in newer versions of Packet</p>
<p>Tracer.</p>
<p>However, new versions of Packet Tracer can open lab files made in older versions of Packet</p>
<p>Tracer.</p>
<p>So, if you have the latest version you should be able to open all of the lab files.</p>
<p>Now, how can you get the lab files I provide for my course?</p>
<p>It’s the same as the Anki flashcards.</p>
<p>If you got the link for the flashcards, the lab files are in that same Google Drive so</p>
<p>there’s no need to follow these steps again.</p>
<p>But I’ll demonstrate once more just in case.</p>
<p>Here is the first lesson of the course again.</p>
<p>In the top line of the description there is this link: Free CCNA flashcards and Packet</p>
<p>Tracer labs for the course.</p>
<p>And the link is jitl.jp&#x2F;ccna-files.</p>
<p>Click on that link and you will be redirected here, to sendfox.com&#x2F;jeremysitlab.</p>
<p>Enter your first name and email here and then click join, and then you should get the files</p>
<p>in your email.</p>
<p>If there are any issues, for example if you don’t get the emails for some reason, send</p>
<p>me an email at <a href="mailto:&#x69;&#x6e;&#102;&#111;&#x40;&#x6a;&#x65;&#114;&#101;&#x6d;&#x79;&#115;&#x69;&#116;&#x6c;&#97;&#x62;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x69;&#x6e;&#102;&#111;&#x40;&#x6a;&#x65;&#114;&#101;&#x6d;&#x79;&#115;&#x69;&#116;&#x6c;&#97;&#x62;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a> and I’ll get back to you when I check my emails.</p>
<p>However please wait at least 10 minutes before you send me an email.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a bit of time for the emails to be sent.</p>
<p>Okay, once you’ve got my lab files, open the lab file labeled ‘Day 1 Lab’ in Packet</p>
<p>Tracer and let’s get started.</p>
<p>Note that, when you install Packet Tracer and then open it, you will have to login to</p>
<p>your Cisco account again.</p>
<p>After that, you should see my lab file like this if you opened Packet Tracer by clicking</p>
<p>on the lab file.</p>
<p>If not, just go to the File menu and click Open to open my lab file.</p>
<p>In my lab files the lab instructions will usually be on the left or bottom of the screen,</p>
<p>and then there will be some devices I’ve already placed in the network.</p>
<p>In this first lab, there is just one router which I have named ‘The Internet’.</p>
<p>Then, the lab instructions tell us to place the other devices to make a network.</p>
<p>Note that, throughout the course I expect that you will be using my pre-made lab files</p>
<p>to do your labs.</p>
<p>You are free to make the labs yourself from scratch, without downloading my lab files,</p>
<p>but that won’t work for all of my labs.</p>
<p>Some labs in the course require ‘troubleshooting’.</p>
<p>In those labs I purposefully made some configuration mistakes, so it’s your job to find those</p>
<p>mistakes and fix them.</p>
<p>Okay, before we go through the lab instructions for this first lab I want to show you the</p>
<p>Packet Tracer preferences menu.</p>
<p>Go to Options in the top menu, and then Preferences.</p>
<p>In this first tab, the Interface tab, you can select things like whether or not Device</p>
<p>Model labels are shown.</p>
<p>I usually have this off, but if I turn it on notice that above ‘The Internet’ 2911</p>
<p>appears.</p>
<p>That is the model name of this router, it’s a Cisco 2911 router, I just named it ‘The</p>
<p>Internet’ to represent the Internet.</p>
<p>I prefer to have device model labels off, so I’ll remove this.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to show the Device Name, you could uncheck this here too, but I think</p>
<p>it’s best to leave the names on.</p>
<p>Anyway, feel free to check out some of these other settings if you want.</p>
<p>I just want to point out one more tab, that is the Font tab.</p>
<p>Here you can change the font sizes in Packet Tracer, for example all of the menu font sizes</p>
<p>or the font size in the devices’ command-line interface.</p>
<p>To make it easier to see in the videos I set the font sizes fairy large, but feel free</p>
<p>to set whatever size you prefer.</p>
<p>You can also change the font colors.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to feel like you’re in the Matrix, change the Router IOS Text</p>
<p>to green, and the Router IOS Background to black.</p>
<p>Then hit apply and exit.</p>
<p>Then click on the Internet router and go to the CLI tab.</p>
<p>And hey, now you’re officially a hacker.</p>
<p>CLI stands for Command-Line Interface, by the way.</p>
<p>This is how we are going to be configuring routers and switches in the course.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ll exit from here and let’s actually do this first lab, which involves</p>
<p>re-creating the network displayed at 16:40 of the Day 1 lecture video about network devices.</p>
<p>Here’s that network.</p>
<p>In the middle there is the Internet.</p>
<p>In this lab I’m just using a router to represent the Internet.</p>
<p>Then there is the New York Branch on the left with some PCs, a switch, a router, and a firewall.</p>
<p>And in the Tokyo branch there are two servers, a switch, a firewall, and a router.</p>
<p>Also somewhere over the Internet there is an attacker.</p>
<p>Okay so let’s re-create that network.</p>
<p>For the routers, the instructions say to use Cisco 2911 routers, the same kind of router</p>
<p>I used for The Internet.</p>
<p>To place a device in Packet Tracer go to the bottom left here and click on this icon for</p>
<p>network devices, and then routers.</p>
<p>Then you can see a selection of router models, let’s select the 2911 and place two of them</p>
<p>in the network.</p>
<p>This is what a Cisco ISR 2911 router looks like, by the way.</p>
<p>‘ISR’ is a line of Cisco routers, and 2911 is a particular model in that line.</p>
<p>Okay, next let’s go to the switches menu here and place two 2960 switches in the network.</p>
<p>Here’s a photo of a Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch, by the way.</p>
<p>Catalyst is the name of a line of Cisco switch models, and 2960 is one model within that</p>
<p>line.</p>
<p>Okay, next we’ll place the two firewalls by going to the firewall menu and placing</p>
<p>two 5505 firewalls.</p>
<p>Note that, in the network diagram in the Day 1 lecture video, the New York branch firewall</p>
<p>is between the router and the Internet, and the Tokyo branch firewall is between the router</p>
<p>and the switch.</p>
<p>Depending on the network design, you might find the firewall placed in either position.</p>
<p>This is a photo of a Cisco ASA 5505 firewall.</p>
<p>ASA is a series of firewalls made by Cisco, and 5505 is a particular model within the</p>
<p>ASA line.</p>
<p>Okay now let’s place the end devices like the PCs and servers.</p>
<p>Go to the ‘end devices’ menu, and here in the end devices tab we can find PCs, servers,</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>So, place two PCs in the New York branch, and two servers in the Tokyo Branch.</p>
<p>Then, to represent the attacker in the diagram place a laptop.</p>
<p>Okay, now all of the devices are placed.</p>
<p>This isn’t in the lab instructions, but let’s rename them to match the diagram in</p>
<p>the lecture video.</p>
<p>To rename a device, just click on the device name.</p>
<p>PC1 already has the correct name, so I’ll start on PC2…then SW1…then R1…then FW1…then</p>
<p>R2…then FW2…then SW2…then SRV1…then SRV2…and finally the attacker.</p>
<p>Okay, now we’ve placed and named all of the devices.</p>
<p>To connect devices in packet tracer, click on this lightning bolt icon here.</p>
<p>Now, in the next video of the course we will study different types of cables used to connect</p>
<p>devices together in a network.</p>
<p>So, for this video we will just let packet tracer pick the cables for us, by clicking</p>
<p>this lightning bolt which says ‘automatically choose connection type’.</p>
<p>So, I’ll click on that, click on PC1, and then click on SW1.</p>
<p>And now they are connected.</p>
<p>Then I’ll do the same to connect PC2 to SW1.</p>
<p>Now, here’s a trick to speed things up.</p>
<p>Hold down the control key on your keyboard and click on the lightning bolt.</p>
<p>Then I’ll connect SW1 to R1.</p>
<p>But notice after connecting them, I don’t have to click the lightning bolt again, it</p>
<p>is still selected because I held down control while clicking it.</p>
<p>So, I’ll connect R1 to FW1, FW1 to the Internet, The Internet to R2, R2 to FW2, FW2 to SW2,</p>
<p>SW2 to SRV1, SW2 to SRV2, and finally the attacker to the Internet.</p>
<p>Now they’re all connected so I’ll click cancel here, since I don’t need to do any</p>
<p>more connections.</p>
<p>Okay, we’re done with the lab instructions.</p>
<p>We have successfully recreated the network diagram as shown in the lecture videos.</p>
<p>Most days of the course will include a packet tracer lab so you can practice configuring</p>
<p>Cisco routers and switches.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should try to complete the lab on your own in packet tracer after watching</p>
<p>the lecture video.</p>
<p>Then you can check my lab video after to confirm your solutions.</p>
<p>However, if you’re having trouble doing the practice labs on your own, feel free to</p>
<p>watch each lab video before actually trying the lab in packet tracer.</p>
<p>That’s not a problem.</p>
<p>The important thing is that you get hands-on practice with Cisco routers and switches to</p>
<p>deepen your understanding of the concepts we cover in the course, and also to prepare</p>
<p>for the exam.</p>
<p>Okay, that’s all for this video.</p>
<p>I hope it was helpful, thanks for watching.</p>
